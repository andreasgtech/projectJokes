A fun little program that tells "funny" jokes :P


This program is a little project I made a couple of summers ago to
practise with opening/closing/writing to/reading from files using C.

It can store and recall stored jokes on user's demand. It's flexible, 
as it can store separately each user's jokes, locally on his computer.


###NOTICE_1###

There is a special implementation for storing "knock-knock" jokes too.
One just needs to follow the on-screen runtime instructions. It's important
not to include a full stop when writing the name in the "knock-knock" joke,
e.g. -Knock knock? -Who's there? -Tom (<-no full stop needed).


###NOTICE_2###

Since any user can (and is prompted to) add his own jokes into the program's
data files, some jokes may be inappropriate for specific social groups. <b>Add
jokes at your own discretion.</b>


###NOTICE_3###

It is strongly advised <b>not</b> to fiddle around with the data files. The program's
correct function strongly depends on the internal structure of these files.
